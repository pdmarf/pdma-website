								<h2>EXPENSEPLUS<br /></h2>
								<p style="text-align: center;">Whether your charity is big or small, ExpensePlus' cloud-based fund accounting software can save you time and money. As a verified ExpensePlus bookkeeper and consultant, my services require your organisation to either already be using ExpensePlus or be willing to migrate to their system, <a href="https://pdmarfleet.co.uk/training-support/#migration">which I can help you with</a>. 
									I am not employed by ExpensePlus, but have extensive user experience with their product. I enjoy a great working relationship with their team and strongly support <a href="https://expenseplus.co.uk/">the excellent work they do</a> in helping churches and charities manage their finances.</p>

								<a id="about" style="margin-top:-200px; margin-bottom: 200px"></a>
								<h2>MORE ABOUT ME<br /></h2>
								<p style="text-align: center;">I have worked in the charity sector as a finance officer for almost a decade, gaining extensive experience in fund accounting and charity finance regulations as a result. I have also served on a leadership team of a church for over 8 years, so I understand the unique challenges of managing medium sized charity accounts, often with only a small or volunteer team.</p>

								<p style="text-align: center;">Over the years that I’ve worked in this sector, it’s been clear that many third sector organisations grow to a point where they are too large to run their own finances off a spreadsheet anymore, but still way too small to be able to justify a staffed finance team with the relevant experience. For some, they find a volunteer who has both the experience and time to give to them, an ideal but increasingly rare solution.</p>
									
								<p style="text-align: center;">For those without that option, I'm pleased to be able to offer charities a cost effective alternative to in-house finance experts.</p>

    			<p>"I would highly recommend PD Marfleet accounting. Not only is he super helpful and patient, but he is also highly skilled in ExpensePlus and understands working with charities. He moved all our accounts onto ExpensePlus and set everything up so that it was easy to use. He also trained us in how to use the new system so that we could capture our information. He manages our monthly accounts in such a way that has saved myself and the team so much time and it makes our annual review with the accountants and auditors a breeze! Over all the years I have worked in the charity sector I have never found managing the financial side as easy as Pete has made it!"</p>

    				<h2>Super Helpful</h2>
    			</div>
    			<p>Pete's been super helpful and supportive whilst we volunteers at church have been getting to grips with ExpensePlus. Because our Treasurer passed away so suddenly, it's been a real challenge to get a team together and move to an online accounting system, but Pete helped assimilate all our previous year's data with his Migration Package. I've found him super-speedy with responding to my email queries - I mean, in minutes, often! So glad that we've opted for his SupportPlus Package where he'll continue to be on hand for as long as we need. Plus, he'll do a weekly check-up to make sure everything's still looking ok on ExpensePlus. Perfect!!</p>

We have the Migration & BookkeegingPlus Packages and I can honestly say, we would be tearing our hair out without Pete. He has taken the time to thoroughly understand how we operate and to ensure that he supports the whole team as we learn this new system. He is hugely encouraging, very patient and a pleasure to work with in addition to being very knowledgeable. I wish we had taken on Pete years ago.</p>

    			</div>
    			<p>Pete Marfleet has been great to work with. He did an excellent and thorough review of our bookkeeping and policies, as a charity needing to keep our procedures on track with our growth. He clearly has an excellent understanding of charity accounting with the added bonus of expertise in ExpensePlus, the specific package we use. He has given us both assurance about our financial management and some good suggestions for improvement. He combined direct and clear communication, timeliness and keeping us informed, with enthusiasm, friendliness, and the willingness to help out with small non-contracted bits of advice along the way. I highly recommend his services to anyone running a small to medium charity.</p>

    			<p>Pete has helped our church get setup on ExpensePlus with very little time before the start of a new financial year. We bought his Migration Package and SupportPlus Package which is great value and has been invaluable. Pete's training is excellent and he's very responsive to support calls. We are now in a much better place with our bookkeeping processes and Pete gently reminds us of things we should be doing that perhaps we weren't! I wouldn't hesitate to recommend his services.</p>
